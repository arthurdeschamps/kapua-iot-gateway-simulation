## Project status of advancement
The simulation's backbone is done.

Some details will be added and more content will be available in the UI.

Maybe the Faker used in the simulation will be modified to make data more realistic.

## Google Summer of Code
This project has been created and developed in the context of the Google Summer of Code, under the guidance of [Jens Reimann](https://github.com/ctron).
