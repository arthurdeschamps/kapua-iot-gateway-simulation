# kapua-iot-gateway-simulation
Supply chain management simulator for kapua. The goal is to build a parameterizable simulator for quick tests of the kapua platform.

For more information, take a look at:
* [Home](docs/general.md) : General information
* [Running](docs/running.md) : Different approaches on how to run the simualation
* [Technical overview](docs/technical-overview.md) : Detailed explanations of the internal functioning of the application
* [Topic system](docs/topic-system.md) : Description of the topic system used for communications

## Project status of advancement
The simulation's backbone is done.

Some details will be added and more content will be available in the UI.

Maybe the Faker used in the simulation will be modified to make data more realistic.

## Google Summer of Code
This project has been created and developed in the context of the Google Summer of Code 2017, under the guidance of [Jens Reimann](https://github.com/ctron).
